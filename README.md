# Basic CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Git, and Docker

Welcome to my project repository where I've built a basic CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Git, and Docker. This project showcases my understanding of setting up an automated workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've created a simple CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building, and deploying a Node.js application. The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Code Commit**: The project code is hosted on Git, enabling collaborative development and version control.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins is used to automatically trigger builds whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository. This ensures that the codebase is consistently integrated and tested.

3. **Continuous Deployment**: Upon successful testing, the application is deployed to a predefined environment. This step ensures that the latest version of the application is readily available for users.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Install Node.js on your machine if it's not already installed.

3. Navigate to the project directory and install project dependencies:

4. Run the application:

## Jenkins Configuration

To set up Jenkins for automated builds and deployments:

1. Install Jenkins on your server and set up necessary plugins.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.

3. Configure the pipeline to fetch code from your Git repository.

4. Define stages in your Jenkinsfile to build, and deploy the application.

5. Configure Jenkins to trigger pipeline execution on code pushes.

## Future Enhancements

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced CI/CD setups. Future enhancements could include:

- Integration with additional testing frameworks for broader test coverage.
- Implementing deployment to multiple environments (e.g., staging, production).
- Adding monitoring and alerting to ensure application health.
